r2m
===

A perl framework to facilitate ETL from relational sources (actually,
anything for which there is a perl DBD/DBI adapter) to MongoDB rich
shape structures in collections.

Best to look at the collection of sample "spec files" (r2m.n.pl) at the
moment to get an idea of how to use it.

More docs in the pod section of R2M.pm.
